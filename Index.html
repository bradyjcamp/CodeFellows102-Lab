<p>
    The Douglas fir tree is an evergreen green and belongs to the pine family. Washington State has its fair share of these trees, which is one of the many reasons this state is always so green year round.

</h3>

<p> 
    Palm trees typically grow in tropical regions with more sunlight (so good luck finding one in Washington). Some produce coconuts but not all of them do, but watch out for those that do because a falling coconut is lethal!

</h3>

<p>
    These lovely maple trees are very common trees that you will often find in your own yard or your neighbors! They may not be native to your area but they make for a great decorative, beautiful tree to complete the look of your yard!
